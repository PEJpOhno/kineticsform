## 1. Overviews  
"kineticsform" is a Python library to set up theoretical reaction kinetics equations from reaction formulas and the rate constats provided as csv file.  

## 2. Current version and requirements  
- current version = 0.0.1   
- pyhon 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10  
- numpy >= 1.20.2  
- pandas >= 1.2.4

## 4. Installation  
Download the directry "src" to a suitable directry on your computer.  
For quick start, put the sample script "kineticsform_sample_script.ipynb"  on the same directry described above. In this case, Jupyter Notebook is required.  

## 5. Usage  
### 5-1. Prepare csv file 
1. Describe reaction formula in csv format. THe first row shoud be header. The first column and the second column should be reaction ID (named RID) and the rate constant (named k). Other column names can be omitted.  
2. The reactants are putted in alternately with the coeficient and the chemical species. Each reaction should be described in one row.  
3. To separate the reactants and the products, two ">" are setted with two columns. 
4. The products are putted in alternately with the coeficient and the chemical species.  
Note the reaction formula should be inputted by the left filling. To describe chemical species, it is better to avoid to use arithmetic symbols such as "+", "-" and "*" (e.g. use "**a**"(nion) in place of "-"). The coefficient '1'　can be substituted for blank.  
The example of a csv format is as follows.  Attached "sample_data.csv" [1] and "sample_data2.csv" [2] are also available for demonstration.  

example of a csv format   

    RID, k,,,,,,,,,,  
    1,0.054,,AcOEt,,OHa1,>,>,,AcOa1,,EtOH  
    2,1.4,,AcOiPr,,OHa1,>,>,,AcOa1,,iPrOH  
    3,0.031,,EGOAc2,2,OHa1,>,>,2,AcOa1,,EG  

### 5-2. Run kineticsform   
1. Import kineticsform.  
```py
from src import kineticsform as kf
```
2. Read the csv file as Pandas DataFrame.  

3. Run the the function "react2kinetics". The argument of the function is the name of the DataFrame.  
```py
kf.react2kinetic(df)
```
If the function run successfully, the number of the unique chemical species, the unique chemidcal species and the kinetic equations as text form, and some list type return value are returned.  

Configuration of the retuned value  
[0]: list of the unique chemical species  
[1]: list of the left-hand side of the differential equation  
[2]: list of the pair of the named rate constant and its value  
[3]: reaction kinetics equations as text form
